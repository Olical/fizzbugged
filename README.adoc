= Fizz Bugged

A broken https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz[Fizz Buzz] implementation in https://clojure.org/[Clojure] that I fix over in my blog post, https://oli.me.uk/conversational-software-development/[conversational software development].

 * `make repl` starts an nREPL + CIDER server, open `src/fizzbugged/main.clj` with https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] installed to begin your conversation with the program.
 * `make run` executes the program and quits.
